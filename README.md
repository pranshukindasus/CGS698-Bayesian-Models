# CGS698-Bayesian-Models & Data Analysis

The assignments concern Bayesian Learning using data; this includes:
1. Prior assumptions for the pro
2. Likelihood function derivation
3. Generating Posterior Distributions

The Descriptions and Codes are provided in the Repository.

Assignment 2: Uses Prior Assumptions and Data-generated Likelihood Functions to Generate the Posterior Distribution.
Assignment 3: Uses methods like Grid Estimation, Analytical Inference, Monte Carlo Integration, Markov's Chain and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Estimation to generate posterior distributions.
Assignment 4: Uses Linear Regression and Poisson Regression to estimate parameters of the probability distribution functions.
